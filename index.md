## About Me

I am a postdoc for both the Democracy and Polarization Lab and American National Election Studies (ANES) at Stanford University. I develop new statistical methods for descriptive and causal inference with applications to political polarization in the US. My research is published or forthcoming at *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, *American Political Science Review*, *The Journal of Politics*, and *Political Analysis*.
