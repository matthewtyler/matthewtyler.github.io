## Bio

I'm an Assistant Professor in the Department of Political Science at Rice University. I specialize in political methodology, with a focus on solving measurement and causal inference challenges in the study of partisan polarization. I am a Principal Investigator on a National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER grant, which supports my work on developing statistical solutions for survey measurement errors, with applications to measuring support for political violence and conspiracy theories. I earned my PhD in Political Science from Stanford University in 2021 and hold bachelor's degrees in Statistical Science and Mathematics from Duke University.
